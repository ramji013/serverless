# serverless

It doesn't mean no servers. In the background it run servers.

In building application, we consider about,
1. where do we deploy application
2. what kind of server, OS to use
3. how to take care of scaling application
4. how to ensure that it is always available

In serverless, we don't need to worry about servers and environment, we just need to focus on building application.
