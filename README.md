# serverless

It doesn't mean no servers. In the background it run servers.

In building application, we consider about,
1. where do we deploy application
2. what kind of server, OS to use
3. how to take care of scaling application
4. how to ensure that it is always available

In serverless, 
1. we don't need to worry about infrastructure (servers and environment), we just need to focus on building application
2. flexible scaling
3. Automated high availability
4. Pay of use

# AWS Lambda:

1. it allows to write and scale your business logic. (can write business logic in any languge, i.e. javascript, python, java, etc...)
2. don't worry about servers, scaling and availability (only worry about code)
3. pay for use
    . Number of requests
    . Duration of requests
    . Memory
